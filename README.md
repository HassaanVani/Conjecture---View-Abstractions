# Conjecture

> Interactive mathematical visualizations that transform abstract concepts into tangible understanding.

## Overview

Conjecture is a collection of animated mathematical visualizations designed to make abstract concepts intuitive. From wave interference patterns to geometric transformations, each visualization helps users build spatial and mathematical intuition through direct interaction.

## Key Features

- **Wave Interference** — Visualize constructive and destructive interference patterns
- **Geometric Transformations** — Explore rotations, reflections, and translations
- **Interactive Controls** — Manipulate parameters in real-time
- **Smooth Animations** — Framer Motion-powered transitions

## Tech Stack

React, TypeScript, Vite, Framer Motion, Zustand, Tailwind CSS
